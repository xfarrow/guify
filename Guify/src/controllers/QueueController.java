		// A necessary but not sufficient condition in order to claim that the
		// Queue
		// works well, is that when it gets opened at time x, all the
		// non-finished
		// transfers initiated in a time t such that t < x must be shown
		// in the table.
		// More specifically, x represents the time of completion of the
		// instruction
		// QueueEventManager.getInstance().addObserver(this); as
		// any subsequent transfer initiated after this point will be guaranteed
		// to
		// be shown in the table (handled by the "update()" method).
		//
		// Having understood this, we may now suppose t1 to be the time of
		// completion of the
		// instruction QueueEventManager.getInstance().getQueue() and t2 to be
		// the time of completion of the instruction
		// QueueEventManager.getInstance().addObserver(this) where t1 < t2.
		// This would've meant that any transfer initiated in a time t such that
		// t1 < t < t2 would not have been adequately processed as "getQueue()"
		// was
		// already executed, and "addObserver(this)" would not have been
		// performed yet,
		// making the transfer not visible in the queue when the Queue frame
		// would've
		// been opened.
		//
		// One could argue that when any chunk of data is transferred at any
		// time t
		// where t > t2, the update() method will be called, showing the
		// transfer in
		// the queue. It's not guaranteed that this happens (as it may encounter
		// an
		// error before t2 and after t1 or simply in may complete in this time
		// frame)

	// Executed on different threads. Called by notifyObservers in
	// QueueEventManager in turn called
	// by the threads created in SshEngine.
	//
	// Keep in mind that:
	// For all distinct pairs of calls on the method update(o, arg)
	// denoted as (update(o, arg)_1 , update(o, arg)_2) having the same
	// object "arg", it holds that
	// ((TransferProgress)arg).getTransferredBytes() evaluated during
	// update(o, arg)_1 is less or equal than
	// ((TransferProgress)arg).getTransferredBytes()
	// evaluated during update(o, arg)_2.
	// In simple words, if update() is called at time t1 and at time t2,
	// where arg is the same TransferProgress object, then the second time
	// the value of
	// transferProgress.getTransferredBytes() will be greater or equal
	// than the value of
	// transferProgress.getTransferredBytes() evaluated the first time.
	// This happens as the transfer of a single object is an operation executed
	// on a single thread, hence any update will have a getTransferredBytes()
	// greater
	// or equal than the previous one.
	//
	// Keep also in mind that SwingUtilities.invokeLater() called at time t1
	// will always run before SwingUtilities.invokeLater() called at time t2
	// where t2 > t1. In other words, the order of execution is kept.
	//
	// This observation may be sufficient to prove that at any
	// time t1, the value of the percentage of a specific TransferProgress
	// will always be equal or greater than the value it was at any time t
	// where t < t1. In other words it's impossible that the progress bar
	// will go down (e.g. from 50% to 49%), but this would be true even if
	// the concept described above would be false. This happens because
	// the TransferProgress
	// handled by manageTransferProgress will always have the latest updated
	// values
	// for that specific object, as it is shared with the thread
	// which continuously updates it.
	// We do not need any locks as no race conditions
	// can happen because in the EDT thread we only read said object, nor any
	// inconsistencies can arise.
